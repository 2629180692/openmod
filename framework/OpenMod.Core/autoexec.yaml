#
# This file defines jobs to be executed automatically by OpenMod.
# ----------
# Scheduling
# ----------
# There are 4 types available for schedule:
# - crontab: Executes a job periodically.
# Must have args.period defined. Visit http://crontab.guru/ for more information on how to define the period.
# - startup: Executes a job after OpenMod and all plugins have loaded.
# - single_exec: Executes a job a single time and then removes it from this file.
# Note: Time is based on local system time
# -----
# Tasks
# -----
# OpenMod has 2 built-in tasks:
# - openmod_command: Executes openmod commands.
# Must have args.commands defined!
# - system_command: Executes a system command (working directory is set to the OpenMod directory).
# Must have args.commands defined!
#
# Note that plugins can add their own task types.
